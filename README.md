# age_flutter

> In Flutter packages, there is a package called age \n
[https://pub.dev/packages/age](https://link)\n
for calculating the age between two different dates.

This package is used in many tutorials 

Unfortunately the original package doesn't support the nullability in dart till 
***01/09/2021***.

This my try to solve the problem by rewrite the package.
